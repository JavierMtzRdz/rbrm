\title{Generative model for rbrm}
\usage{
generate_data(pa, pb, n, n_test, alpha, beta, gamma)
}
\arguments{
\item{pa}{the number of alpha coefficients without the intercept}

\item{pb}{the number of beta coefficients without the intercept}

\item{n}{number of samples in training set}

\item{n_test}{the number of samples in the test set}

\item{alpha}{the true alpha coefficients that are used to generate data.
This list should include the intercept coefficient.}

\item{beta}{the true beta coefficients that are used to generate data.
This list should include the intercept coefficient.}

\item{gamma}{the true gamma coefficients that are used to generate
the propensity for exposure This list should not include the intercept.
The intercept value will be estimated numerically to achieve an
even proportion of exposure in the training data.}
